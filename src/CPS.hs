{-| CHANGELOG

EVIL HACK FEB 2022: All local bindings are now treated as 0-ary functions.
Variables are (in general, but with one exception) no longer simple; they 
need to be "forced" by passing them a continuation.

We have to do this because local definitions may contain function calls, but the
call graph doesn't record those local function calls properly.

{- | A Decl but in CPS. We use some hacks here to accomplish our goals:
(1) All Haskell Decls get converted into a name binding an expression in
    the following way:
      foo x 0 = bar x where ...1
      foo x 1 = baz x where ...2
    becomes
      foo k = case Const of
        { (x, Const) -> let ...1 in [[bar x]]_k
        ; (x, Const) -> let ...2 in [[baz x]]_k
        }
    Guards are handled the same way as for case expressions.
(2) This includes simple pattern bindings (which may be eta-reduced function
    bindings, otherwise we would just ignored them), so that
      foo = go 0 where ...
    becomes
      foo k = let ... in [[go 0]]_k
(3) non-simple pattern bindings, like (a, b) = (useX1, useX2) where X = ...
    are not allowed.

Note that the first 2 points are a major CPS semantics break; the result is
not actually a function! However it is sufficient for our needs, which are
to make the order of evaluation in the body explicit.

-- Renaming

This section is for the renaming of subexpressions in a CpsExp tree. The idea
is that _any_ name bound locally (i.e. not globally) gets replaced by a Unique
at its binding site and everywhere it is used.

-- | "Renamer"
-- (this is a common abbreviation in compilers)
type Rn = State Int

runRn :: Rn a -> a
runRn = flip evalState 0

freshRn :: Name -> Rn Unique
freshRn = fresh Renaming

-- | Rename an entire module of CpsBindings.
renameModule :: CpsModule -> CpsModule
renameModule = runRn . mapM renameBinding

-- | Rename all bound variables in a Binding. This results in renaming the
-- arguments of the binding, if it had any, but not the binding itself.
-- Intended for global bindings; local bindings are handled by a call to
-- 'renameThingMany' in 'renameSubexp'.
renameBinding :: CpsBinding -> Rn CpsBinding
renameBinding (Binding bndr k body) = Binding bndr k <$> renameExp body

-- | Rename all bound variables in an entire CpsExp to disambiguate them.
-- In the resulting CpsExp, the only raw binders are free variables of the
-- input.

-- transformM works bottom-up, which correctly handles shadowing naturally!

-- the given unique.

-- | Replace all instances of each raw name in the input with the
-- corresponding unique.
renameThingMany :: Data thing => [(Name, Unique)] -> thing -> thing
renameThingMany pairs thing = foldr (uncurry renameThingOnce) thing pairs

-- | Rename a CPS Subexpression by inspecting the root node only.
-- If the root node binds any names, fresh uniques are generated for them
-- and the entire scope of each binding is renamed with its unique,
-- including the binding site itself.

{- | A Decl but in CPS. We use some hacks here to accomplish our goals:
(1) All Haskell Decls get converted into a name binding a function in
    the following way:
      foo x 0 = bar x where ...1
      foo x 1 = baz x where ...2
    becomes
      foo k = case Const of
        { (x, Const) -> let ...1 in [[bar x]]_k
        ; (x, Const) -> let ...2 in [[baz x]]_k 
        }
    Guards are handled the same way as for case expressions.
(2) This includes simple pattern bindings (which may be eta-reduced function
    bindings, otherwise we would just ignored them), so that
      foo = go 0 where ...
    becomes
      foo k = let ... in [[go 0]]_k
(3) non-simple pattern bindings, like (a, b) = (useX1, useX2) where X = ...
    are not allowed.

Note that the first 2 points are a major CPS semantics break; the function
(if it even _is_ a function) will not take its continuation last and there is,
of course, no guarantee in Haskell at all that functions will be fully applied
when they are called. So don't try and use CpsDecls to evaluate code!

Extension-based cases are handled with an explicit error as future proofing.
In practice, haskell-src-exts will give a parse error unless the module being

default-extensions). We (CS 421 @ UIUC) don't enable extensions, so those
